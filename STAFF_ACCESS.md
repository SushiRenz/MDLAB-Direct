# Staff & Admin Login Access

## For Staff Members Only

To access the staff/admin login portal, use one of these URLs:

### Local Development:
- `http://localhost:5173/staff`
- `http://localhost:5173/admin`
- `http://localhost:5173/staff-login`

### Production (Network):
- `http://192.168.1.112:5173/staff`
- `http://192.168.1.112:5173/admin`
- `http://192.168.1.112:5173/staff-login`

### Security Note:
- The staff login is **not accessible** from the patient login page
- There are no visible buttons or links to the staff portal on the patient interface
- Only staff members who know the direct URL can access the staff login
- This prevents curious patients from attempting to access restricted areas

## Patient Access:
Patients should use the regular homepage:
- Local: `http://localhost:5173/`
- Network: `http://192.168.1.112:5173/`

**Keep this URL confidential and share only with authorized staff members.**
