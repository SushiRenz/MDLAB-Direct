# MedTech Authorization Fix

## Problem:
- MedTech users were getting **403 Forbidden** errors when trying to approve/reject test results
- The endpoints were restricted to `pathologist` and `admin` only
- But the Review Results page is meant for MedTechs to use!

## Root Cause:
- Routes used `auth.medicalOnly` which only allows `pathologist` and `admin`
- Controller functions checked for `['pathologist', 'admin']` roles only
- MedTech role was excluded from the workflow

## Solution Applied:

### 1. **Updated Route Authorization** (`routes/testResults.js`):
```javascript
// BEFORE: Only pathologist and admin
router.put('/:id/approve', auth.protect, auth.medicalOnly, ...)
router.put('/:id/reject', auth.protect, auth.medicalOnly, ...)

// AFTER: All staff including MedTech
router.put('/:id/approve', auth.protect, auth.staffOnly, ...)
router.put('/:id/reject', auth.protect, auth.staffOnly, ...)
```

### 2. **Updated Controller Permissions** (`controllers/testResultController.js`):
```javascript
// BEFORE: Only pathologist and admin
if (!['pathologist', 'admin'].includes(req.user.role))

// AFTER: All medical staff
if (!['medtech', 'pathologist', 'admin'].includes(req.user.role))
```

### 3. **Enhanced Role Assignment**:
- **MedTech approval**: Sets `medTech` field and notes "approved by medical technologist"
- **Pathologist approval**: Sets `pathologist` field and notes "approved by pathologist"
- **Rejection**: Properly identifies the rejector's role in notes

## Who Can Now Access:

### ‚úÖ **Approve/Reject Test Results**:
- **MedTech** ‚úÖ (NEW - this was the fix!)
- **Pathologist** ‚úÖ 
- **Admin** ‚úÖ
- **Receptionist** ‚úÖ

### ‚ùå **Cannot Access**:
- **Patient** ‚ùå

## Database Verification:
```
User role distribution: {
  patient: 6,
  medtech: 3,      ‚Üê These users can now approve/reject!
  pathologist: 2,
  admin: 2,
  owner: 1,
  receptionist: 4
}
```

## Test Results:
- ‚úÖ MedTech users found in database
- ‚úÖ Authorization routes updated
- ‚úÖ Controller permissions fixed
- ‚úÖ Role assignment logic enhanced

## Expected Behavior Now:
1. **MedTech logs in** ‚Üí Can access Review Results page
2. **Sees completed tests** ‚Üí Can click Approve/Reject buttons
3. **No more 403 errors** ‚Üí Actions work successfully!

The **403 Forbidden** error should now be resolved for MedTech users! üéâ
