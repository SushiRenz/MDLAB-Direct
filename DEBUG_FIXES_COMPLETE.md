# 🛠️ DEBUGGING FIXES APPLIED

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **"Too Many Login Attempts" Problem - SOLVED**

**What was causing it:**
- Rate limiting middleware was restricting logins to 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- Account lockout mechanism was locking accounts after failed attempts
- These weren't resetting properly during development

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ **Disabled rate limiting** in development mode
- ✅ **Disabled account locking** in development mode  
- ✅ **Set high login attempt limits** (1000 attempts)
- ✅ **Added development environment detection**

### 2. **Session Persistence Problem - SOLVED**

**What was causing it:**
- Frontend was restoring sessions from localStorage without validating with backend
- Users could reload and get wrong dashboard if localStorage had old/invalid data
- No proper session validation on app startup

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ **Added session validation** - Now checks with backend before restoring session
- ✅ **Improved role-based routing** - Fresh user data from backend determines dashboard
- ✅ **Better logout handling** - Completely clears session data
- ✅ **Error handling** - Invalid sessions are cleared automatically

### **Test 1: Login Attempts (Should work unlimited now)**
1. Go to Staff Portal (arrow button)
2. Try logging in with **wrong passwords multiple times**
3. **Expected:** No "too many attempts" error anymore ✅
4. **Expected:** Can keep trying indefinitely ✅

### **Test 2: Role-Based Session (Should route correctly)**
1. **Login as Admin:**
   - Username: `admin` | Password: `Admin123!`
   - **Expected:** Redirects to Main Dashboard ✅

2. **Login as MedTech:**
   - Username: `medtech1` | Password: `MedTech123!` 
   - **Expected:** Redirects to MedTech Dashboard (blue theme) ✅

3. **Login as Pathologist:**
   - Username: `pathologist1` | Password: `Pathologist123!`
   - **Expected:** Redirects to Pathologist Dashboard (purple theme) ✅

### **Test 3: Session Persistence (Should maintain correct user)**
1. **Login with any role**
2. **Reload the page (F5)**
3. **Expected:** Stays in the SAME dashboard for SAME role ✅
