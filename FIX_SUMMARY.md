# Review Results Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Wrong API URL (401 Unauthorized Error)**
- **Problem**: Frontend was making requests to `http://192.168.1.112:5173` (frontend port) instead of backend port 5000
- **Solution**: Updated `ReviewResults.jsx` to use `testResultsAPI` service instead of direct fetch calls
- **Fixed**: Proper routing to `http://192.168.1.112:5000/api/test-results/...`

### 2. **Authentication Token Issues**
- **Problem**: API service was looking for tokens in `sessionStorage` but some parts of app used `localStorage`
- **Solution**: Updated API interceptor to check both storage locations
- **Fixed**: Consistent token handling across the application

### 3. **Simplified Rejection Process**
- **Problem**: User wanted to remove the rejection reason prompt
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed `prompt()` and replaced with simple `confirm()` dialog
  - Made rejection reason optional in backend validation
  - Added default rejection reason: "Test result requires correction and resubmission"

### 4. **Added Missing API Methods**
- **Problem**: Frontend was using methods that didn't exist in the API service
- **Solution**: Added `approveTestResult()` and `rejectTestResult()` methods to `testResultsAPI`

## Files Modified:

### Frontend:
1. **`/frontend/src/pages/ReviewResults.jsx`**:
   - Fixed `handleRejectTest()` to use simple confirmation
   - Fixed `handleConfirmApproval()` to use proper API service
   - Both functions now use `testResultsAPI` instead of direct fetch

2. **`/frontend/src/services/api.js`**:
   - Added `approveTestResult()` method
   - Added `rejectTestResult()` method  
   - Fixed token interceptor to check both `sessionStorage` and `localStorage`
   - Updated cleanup functions to clear both storage locations

### Backend:
3. **`/backend/routes/testResults.js`**:
   - Made `rejectionReason` optional (not required) for reject endpoint

4. **`/backend/controllers/testResultController.js`**:
   - Added default rejection reason when none provided

## How It Works Now:

1. **Approve Process**:
   - User clicks "Approve" → Confirmation modal → Uses `/api/test-results/:id/approve`
   - Status changes from `completed` → `reviewed`

2. **Reject Process**:
   - User clicks "Reject" → Simple confirmation dialog → Uses `/api/test-results/:id/reject`
   - Status changes from `completed` → `rejected`
   - Default reason: "Test result requires correction and resubmission"

3. **Authentication**:
   - Tokens work from both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`
   - Proper Authorization headers sent with all requests
   - Requests go to correct backend port (5000)

## Testing:
- ✅ API endpoints respond correctly (401 when unauthenticated)
- ✅ Backend server is healthy and connected to MongoDB
- ✅ Token authentication fixed
- ✅ Simplified rejection process implemented

## Next Steps:
1. Test in browser with actual pathologist/admin user
2. Verify approve/reject functions work as expected
3. Check that rejected tests appear in MedTech queue
4. Confirm approved tests move to proper status
